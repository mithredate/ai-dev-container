# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- GitHub Actions workflows go in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Commit messages follow pattern: `feat: [US-XXX] - Story Title`
- Project has no package.json or Makefile - no standard quality check commands
- YAML validation can be done with Python's yaml module or similar tools

## 2026-01-19 01:30:55 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Created `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` workflow file
  - Workflow triggers on: push to main branch, version tags (v*.*.*), and workflow_dispatch
  - Named "Build and Publish Docker Image" with job "Build and Push Docker Image"
  - Includes checkout step using actions/checkout@v4
- Files changed:
  - `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` (new file)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The Write tool can create parent directories automatically
  - No built-in linting tools in this project - YAML validation requires external tools
  - Workflow structure: name, on (triggers), jobs with steps
---

## 2026-01-19 - US-002
- What was implemented:
  - Added GHCR authentication to the workflow using docker/login-action@v3
  - Set permissions (contents: read, packages: write) at job level
  - Created environment variables for REGISTRY (ghcr.io) and IMAGE_NAME (${{ github.repository }})
  - Added docker/build-push-action@v5 for building and pushing images
  - Image pushed to ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }} namespace
- Files changed:
  - `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - docker/login-action@v3 is the standard way to authenticate to GHCR
  - GITHUB_TOKEN is accessed via secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN
  - Use env vars at workflow level for reusable values like registry URL and image name
  - Permissions should be set at job level when using GITHUB_TOKEN for packages
