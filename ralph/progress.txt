# Ralph Progress Log
Started:

## Codebase Patterns
- This is a Go project with Docker containerization for Claude Code
- Quality checks: `go vet ./...` and `go build ./...`
- Shell scripts in `/scripts/` use POSIX sh (dash compatible), not bash
- The entrypoint uses `exec` to replace the shell process with the target command
- Container starts as root for firewall setup, use `run_as_user` to drop privileges to claude user
- Config files now live in `.aidevcontainer/` (bridge.yaml, allowed-domains.txt)
