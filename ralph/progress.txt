## Codebase Patterns
- GitHub Actions workflows go in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Commit messages follow pattern: `feat: [US-XXX] - Story Title`
- Project has no package.json or Makefile - no standard quality check commands
- YAML validation can be done with Python's yaml module or similar tools

## 2026-01-19 01:30:55 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Created `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` workflow file
  - Workflow triggers on: push to main branch, version tags (v*.*.*), and workflow_dispatch
  - Named "Build and Publish Docker Image" with job "Build and Push Docker Image"
  - Includes checkout step using actions/checkout@v4
- Files changed:
  - `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` (new file)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The Write tool can create parent directories automatically
  - No built-in linting tools in this project - YAML validation requires external tools
  - Workflow structure: name, on (triggers), jobs with steps
