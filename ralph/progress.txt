# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-24

## Current Feature
Dynamic Command Routing with Native Overrides (feat/dynamic-command-routing)

## Codebase Patterns
- This is a Go project with Docker containerization for Claude Code
- Quality checks: `go vet ./...` and `go build ./...`
- Shell scripts in `/scripts/` use POSIX sh (dash compatible), not bash
- The entrypoint uses `exec` to replace the shell process with the target command
- Container starts as root for firewall setup, use `run_as_user` to drop privileges to claude user
- Config files now live in `.sidecar/` (bridge.yaml, allowed-domains.txt)

## 2026-01-24 - #9/US-001
- Set up integration test infrastructure
- Files changed:
  - `.test/bridge.yaml` - Bridge config with go command routing to test-golang
  - `.test/compose.yaml` - Docker compose with claude and golang containers
  - `.test/run-tests.sh` - Test script that validates bridge routing
  - `.test/workspace/main.go` - Simple Go program that prints "Hello"
  - `.test/workspace/go.mod` - Go module file for workspace
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The bridge uses static `workdir` from config, not caller's CWD (US-005 will fix this)
  - Test files must be placed at path matching bridge.yaml workdir setting
  - Docker compose cp requires destination directory to exist (create with mkdir -p first)
  - Go modules require go.mod file even for simple single-file builds
  - SIDECAR_CONFIG_DIR env var controls where bridge looks for bridge.yaml
