# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Mon Jan 19 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `COPY --chmod=755` in Dockerfile to set script permissions in a single layer
- Shell scripts use `#!/bin/sh` with `shellcheck shell=dash` directive for POSIX compatibility
- Scripts log to stderr with a prefix like `[scriptname]` for visibility

## 2026-01-19 - US-001
Thread: N/A (first iteration)
- Created `/scripts/entrypoint.sh` wrapper script
- Script uses `exec claude "$@"` to replace shell process with Claude CLI
- Logs startup message to stderr for visibility
- Files changed: `scripts/entrypoint.sh` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing `scripts/bridge` provides good template for shell script style
  - No package.json or Makefile - quality checks limited to shellcheck (not installed locally)
  - Docker daemon not running on host, so image builds can't be tested locally
