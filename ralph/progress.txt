# Ralph Progress Log
Started:

## Codebase Patterns
- This is a Go project with Docker containerization for Claude Code
- Quality checks: `go vet ./...` and `go build ./...`
- Shell scripts in `/scripts/` use POSIX sh (dash compatible), not bash
- The entrypoint uses `exec` to replace the shell process with the target command
- Container starts as root for firewall setup, use `run_as_user` to drop privileges to claude user
- Config files now live in `.aidevcontainer/` (bridge.yaml, allowed-domains.txt)

---

## 2026-01-22 - Documentation Update
- Added "One-Session Setup Prompt" section to readme.md
- Prompt guides Claude to set up the complete integration in a single session
- Generic enough to work with any tech stack (Go, PHP, Laravel, TypeScript, Nuxt, etc.)
- Covers: compose.yml updates, bridge.yaml creation, CLAUDE.md documentation, allowed-domains.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The examples directory contains comprehensive templates for reference
  - Bridge configuration supports path mappings for different container workdirs
  - CLAUDE.md template in examples/ has a good "Do Not" section for multi-container gotchas
