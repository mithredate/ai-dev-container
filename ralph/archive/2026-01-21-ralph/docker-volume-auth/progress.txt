## Codebase Patterns
- Use `COPY --chmod=755` in Dockerfile to set script permissions in a single layer
- Shell scripts use `#!/bin/sh` with `shellcheck shell=dash` directive for POSIX compatibility
- Scripts log to stderr with a prefix like `[scriptname]` for visibility
- Go module: `github.com/mithredate/ai-dev-container`, use `go build ./cmd/bridge` to build
- Go CLI uses standard library `flag` package for argument parsing
- Dockerfile Go version must match go.mod (currently requires Go 1.24+)
- Docker image size ~359MB due to: node:20-alpine (144MB) + docker-cli (31MB) + claude-code (87MB)
- Wrapper scripts go in /scripts/wrappers/ (not /usr/local/bin/) - prepend to PATH for precedence
- Node/npm/npx wrappers use CLAUDE_STARTING=1 env var to allow Claude Code startup with native node, then route subsequent calls through bridge
- Use named Docker volumes for credential storage instead of bind mounts (more portable across UID mismatches)
- Claude Code Viewer npx container mounts volumes to `/root/.claude` (not `/home/node/.claude`) since npx runs as root
- Alpine uses `apk` for package management, not `apt-get`
- Alpine iptables/ipset syntax is same as Debian
