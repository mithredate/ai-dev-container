# Claude Container Entrypoint
# ===========================
# Persistent container entrypoint that keeps the container alive.
# Claude is started manually via: docker compose exec claude claude
#
# The container starts as root to initialize the firewall, then drops
# to the 'claude' user for all subsequent operations. The firewall
# persists for the lifetime of the container.
