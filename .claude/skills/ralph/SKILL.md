# Ralph PRD Converter

Converts existing PRDs to the prd.json format that Ralph uses for autonomous execution. Also handles cleanup of completed stories.

---

## What is Ralph Loop?

Ralph loop is an autonomous agent system that spawns Claude Code instances to implement user stories one at a time. Each iteration:

1. Spawns a fresh Claude Code instance with no memory of previous work
2. Assigns it one user story to implement
3. Verifies acceptance criteria
4. Loops through remaining stories until all pass

Because each Claude Code instance has a fresh context window, stories must be small enough to complete in a single iteration.

---

## The Job

**Convert mode:** Take a PRD (markdown file or text) and append stories to `prd.json` in your ralph directory.

**Cleanup mode:** Archive completed stories (`passes: true`) from prd.json.

---

## Output Format

**Branch name prefixes:**
- `feat/` - new feature
- `fix/` - bug fix
- `chore/` - maintenance, config, dependencies
- `refactor/` - code restructuring
- `docs/` - documentation only
- `test/` - adding/updating tests

```json
{
  "project": "[Project Name]",
  "branchName": "[type]/[short-description-kebab-case]",
  "description": "[Feature description from PRD title/intro]",
  "storyIdPrefix": "US",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "[Story title]",
      "description": "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Criterion 1",
        "Criterion 2",
        "Code quality checks pass",
        "Tests pass (if applicable)"
      ],
      "testCases": [
        {
          "type": "happy_path",
          "description": "Valid input produces expected output"
        },
        {
          "type": "edge_case",
          "description": "Empty input returns empty result"
        },
        {
          "type": "validation",
          "description": "Invalid input returns appropriate error"
        }
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "attempts": 0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Story ID Format

**Ask the user for their preferred story ID format.** If not specified, default to `US-XXX`.

Examples of valid formats:
- `US-001`, `US-002`, `US-003` (default)
- `DA-18`, `DA-19`, `DA-20`
- `PROJ-100`, `PROJ-101`, `PROJ-102`
- `T-1`, `T-2`, `T-3`

The `storyIdPrefix` field in prd.json stores the prefix (e.g., "US", "DA", "PROJ", "T").

When adding stories to an existing prd.json:
1. Find the highest existing story number
2. Continue from the next number
3. Preserve the existing prefix

---

## Story Size: The Number One Rule

**Each story must be completable in ONE Ralph loop iteration (one context window).**

Ralph loop spawns a fresh Claude Code instance per iteration with no memory of previous work. If a story is too big, the LLM runs out of context before finishing and produces broken code.

### Right-sized stories:
- Add a database column and migration
- Add a UI component to an existing page
- Update a server action with new logic
- Add a filter dropdown to a list

### Too big (split these):
- "Build the entire dashboard" → Split into: schema, queries, UI components, filters
- "Add authentication" → Split into: schema, middleware, login UI, session handling
- "Refactor the API" → Split into one story per endpoint or pattern

**Rule of thumb:** If you cannot describe the change in 2-3 sentences, it is too big.

---

## Story Ordering: Dependencies First

Stories execute in priority order. Earlier stories must not depend on later ones.

**Correct order:**
1. Schema/database changes (migrations)
2. Server actions / backend logic
3. UI components that use the backend
4. Dashboard/summary views that aggregate data
5. Documentation updates

**Wrong order:**
1. UI component (depends on schema that does not exist yet)
2. Schema change

---

## Acceptance Criteria: Must Be Verifiable

Each criterion must be something Claude Code can CHECK, not something vague.

### Good criteria (verifiable):
- "Add `status` column to tasks table with default 'pending'"
- "Filter dropdown has options: All, Active, Completed"
- "Clicking delete shows confirmation dialog"
- "Code quality checks pass"
- "Tests pass"

### Bad criteria (vague):
- "Works correctly"
- "User can do X easily"
- "Good UX"
- "Handles edge cases"

### Always include as final criteria:

**Code quality checks pass** - The specific checks depend on the project:
- **Go:** `go fmt`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint`
- **PHP:** `phpstan`, `php-cs-fixer`
- **TypeScript/JavaScript:** `eslint`, `prettier`, `tsc --noEmit`
- **Python:** `ruff`, `mypy`, `black`
- **Rust:** `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`

Claude Code should inspect the project to determine which checks apply.

**Tests pass (if applicable)** - Include when:
- The story adds or modifies testable logic
- The project has an existing test suite
- The acceptance criteria can be verified by automated tests

### For stories that change UI, also include:
```
"Verify in browser using dev-browser skill"
```

Frontend stories are NOT complete until visually verified. Claude Code will use the dev-browser skill to navigate to the page, interact with the UI, and confirm changes work.

---

## Test Cases (Optional)

Stories may include explicit test cases to guide implementation and verification:

```json
"testCases": [
  {
    "type": "happy_path",
    "description": "Creating a task with valid data succeeds"
  },
  {
    "type": "edge_case", 
    "description": "Creating a task with maximum length title succeeds"
  },
  {
    "type": "validation",
    "description": "Creating a task with empty title returns validation error"
  },
  {
    "type": "error",
    "description": "Database connection failure returns 500 error"
  }
]
```

Test case types:
- `happy_path` - Normal expected usage
- `edge_case` - Boundary conditions, limits, unusual but valid inputs
- `validation` - Invalid input handling
- `error` - System failures, external service errors

Test cases are optional. Include them when:
- The PRD specifies specific scenarios to handle
- The logic has known edge cases
- Validation rules are defined

---

## Attempts and Notes Fields

**`attempts`**: Tracks how many times Ralph loop has tried to complete this story. Starts at 0, incremented on each attempt. Useful for:
- Identifying problematic stories that keep failing
- Setting retry limits in Ralph loop configuration

**`notes`**: Used by Ralph loop to record what happened during attempts. Examples:
- "Attempt 1: Failed - missing dependency on UserService"
- "Attempt 2: Tests failing on edge case with empty input"
- "Blocked: Requires API key not available in environment"

Claude Code should update notes after each attempt to help subsequent iterations understand what went wrong.

---

## Conversion Rules

1. **Each user story becomes one JSON entry**
2. **Ask for story ID format** or continue from existing stories (see "Story ID Format" above)
3. **Priority**: Recalculate for ALL stories based on dependency order
4. **New stories**: `passes: false`, `attempts: 0`, and empty `notes`
5. **branchName**: Use conventional prefix (`feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `test/`) + short description in kebab-case
6. **Always add**: "Code quality checks pass" to every story's acceptance criteria
7. **Add when applicable**: "Tests pass" for stories with testable logic

---

## Adding to Existing prd.json

**IMPORTANT: Always read existing prd.json before writing new stories.**

### Steps:

1. **Read existing prd.json** if it exists
2. **Find the highest story ID number** (e.g., if DA-019 exists, next is DA-020)
3. **Keep all existing stories** - do not remove or modify them
4. **Append new stories** with IDs continuing the sequence
5. **Reprioritize ALL stories** (existing + new) based on dependency order

### ID Sequencing Example:

**Existing prd.json has:**
- DA-018, DA-019, DA-020

**New PRD adds 2 stories:**
- New story 1 → DA-021
- New story 2 → DA-022

### Priority Recalculation:

When adding new stories, analyze dependencies across ALL stories (existing + new) and reassign priorities:

1. List all stories (existing + new)
2. Build dependency graph (which stories depend on which)
3. Assign priorities so no story depends on a higher-priority story
4. Stories with `passes: true` should generally keep lower priorities (they're done)

**Example:**
- Existing DA-018 (passes: true, priority: 1) - schema change
- Existing DA-019 (passes: false, priority: 2) - uses schema
- New DA-021 - new schema change (must run before DA-019)

After reprioritization:
- DA-018: priority 1 (done, schema)
- DA-021: priority 2 (new schema, must run before DA-019)
- DA-019: priority 3 (depends on both schemas)

---

## Handling PRD Updates

When requirements change while stories are in progress:

1. **Read the existing prd.json**
2. **Identify all stories with `passes: false`** (incomplete stories)
3. **Compare new requirements against incomplete stories**
4. **Re-evaluate and update:**
   - Modify acceptance criteria if requirements changed
   - Add new stories for new requirements
   - Mark stories as obsolete in notes if no longer needed (but don't delete)
5. **Reprioritize all incomplete stories** based on new dependency order

Claude Code should inspect the codebase to ensure updated stories reference correct existing patterns and are in a valid state.

---

## Cleanup Mode

When the user asks to **cleanup** or **archive completed stories**, follow these steps:

### Trigger phrases:
- "cleanup prd"
- "archive completed stories"
- "remove passed stories"

### Cleanup Steps:

1. **Read current prd.json**
2. **Identify stories with `passes: true`**
3. **Archive them:**
   - Create archive folder: `archive/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss-cleanup/`
   - Save completed stories to `archive/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss-cleanup/completed-stories.json`
   - Copy current `progress.txt` to archive (if exists)
4. **Update prd.json:**
   - Remove all stories with `passes: true`
   - Keep all stories with `passes: false`
   - Recalculate priorities for remaining stories (1, 2, 3, ...)
5. **Reset progress.txt** with fresh header (if applicable)

### Cleanup Example:

**Before cleanup (prd.json):**
```json
{
  "userStories": [
    {"id": "DA-018", "passes": true, "priority": 1},
    {"id": "DA-019", "passes": true, "priority": 2},
    {"id": "DA-020", "passes": false, "priority": 3},
    {"id": "DA-021", "passes": false, "priority": 4}
  ]
}
```

**After cleanup (prd.json):**
```json
{
  "userStories": [
    {"id": "DA-020", "passes": false, "priority": 1},
    {"id": "DA-021", "passes": false, "priority": 2}
  ]
}
```

**Archived (archive/2024-01-15-143052-cleanup/completed-stories.json):**
```json
{
  "archivedAt": "2024-01-15T14:30:52Z",
  "stories": [
    {"id": "DA-018", "passes": true, "priority": 1},
    {"id": "DA-019", "passes": true, "priority": 2}
  ]
}
```

Note: Story IDs are NOT renumbered during cleanup - DA-020 stays DA-020. Only priorities are recalculated.

---

## Splitting Large PRDs

If a PRD has big features, split them:

**Original:**
> "Add user notification system"

**Split into:**
1. DA-018: Add notifications table to database
2. DA-019: Create notification service for sending notifications
3. DA-020: Add notification bell icon to header
4. DA-021: Create notification dropdown panel
5. DA-022: Add mark-as-read functionality
6. DA-023: Add notification preferences page
7. DA-024: Update documentation for notification system

Each is one focused change that can be completed and verified independently.

## Example

**Input PRD:**
```markdown
# Task Status Feature

Add ability to mark tasks with different statuses.

## Requirements
- Toggle between pending/in-progress/done on task list
- Filter list by status
- Show status badge on each task
- Persist status in database

## Archiving Previous Runs

**Before writing a new prd.json, check if there is an existing one from a different feature:**

1. Read the current `prd.json` if it exists
2. Check if `branchName` differs from the new feature's branch name
3. If different AND there are stories with `passes: true` or `attempts > 0`:
    - Create archive folder: `archive/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss-[feature-name]/`
    - Copy current `prd.json` and `progress.txt` to archive
    - Reset `progress.txt` with fresh header

---

## Checklist Before Saving

Before writing prd.json, verify:

- [ ] **Asked user for story ID format** or found existing format in prd.json
- [ ] **Read existing prd.json first** (if it exists)
- [ ] **Story IDs continue from highest existing ID** (not restarting sequence)
- [ ] **Previous run archived** (if prd.json exists with different branchName)
- [ ] Each story is completable in one iteration (small enough)
- [ ] **All priorities recalculated** based on dependencies (existing + new stories)
- [ ] Stories are ordered by dependency (schema → backend → UI → docs)
- [ ] Every story has "Code quality checks pass" as criterion
- [ ] Stories with testable logic have "Tests pass" as criterion
- [ ] UI stories have "Verify in browser using dev-browser skill" as criterion
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are verifiable (not vague)
- [ ] No story depends on a higher-priority story
- [ ] New stories have `attempts: 0` and empty `notes`
